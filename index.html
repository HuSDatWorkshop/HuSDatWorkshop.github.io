      <div class="row">
        <p>With the rise and frequent opacity of big data, there has been a growing need to understand who is working in data science and how they are doing their work. Researchers in HCI, CSCW, and critical data studies have begun to examine these questions (for more detail, see <a href="#background">Background</a> below). In this workshop, we invite researchers and practitioners to share their observations, experiences, hypotheses, and insights. Depending on participant interest, we hope to answer questions such as the following.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How do data science workers approach their tasks? What are their strategies? What can we learn about their views of data and process [4, 9, 25, 28]?</li>
          <li>What (and who) is missed in our prevailing accounts and assumptions around data and data work? If "data is never raw" [10], who does the cooking, and how is this work performed, recognized, and accounted for?</li>
          <li>Data science tools are generally designed for one user at a time. Other complex tasks have benefited greatly from collaboration practices and collaboration technologies. Are there opportunities to bring some of these lessons to data science? What are the distinctive collaboration needs and constraints in data science [3, 26]?</li>
          <li>What methods are valid and tractable to assess the usefulness and usability of tools for data scientists in service of iterative design? How can learnability be assessed when domain experts, not programmers, need to learn new languages and tools simultaneously, the learning of which takes far longer than typical usability studies? How can efficiency for skilled users be assessed when the uses of the tools are so diverse that benchmark tasks have little face validity?</li>
          <li>Who are the consumers of data sciene work and what are their needs? How can data science processes and tools address these needs, e.g., the level of transparency and comprehension consumers desire?</li>

        <p>HCI engagement with data science is relatively new for most people. Therefore, we will spend a half-day to share knowledge and perspectives in this domain, through brief presentations of participantsâ€™ position papers (which we will make available in advance, at the workshop website). The focus will be on the intersection of data science and HCI. Co-organizers will organize the presentations into "mini-sessions" based on common themes. We will conclude the morning by organizing the afternoon session into small groups, formed through recognition of shared interests during the morning discussions. The afternoon will conclude with small-group reports, a plan for future meetings, plans for a workshop report, and an optional informal dinner.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <p>Extraordinary claims are made about the promises and current successes of data science [1, 8, 14, 15, 19, 22, 29, 33] While some of these claims are stated for the future [7], Agarwal and Dhar editorialized in 2014 that "This is powerful... we are in principle already there"[2]. Meanwhile to the dystopian extreme, scholars warn about the "mythology" of working with big data, that the quantitative nature of data gives a false illusion that all data-driven outcomes are objective, ethical, or true [5]. Further complicating these discussions, there is considerable diversity in the tools and methods [12], challenges [13], and job-roles [15, 19, 23] involved in data science. Detailed study will be necessarily partial and contextualized, adding depth of description and understanding, but potentially lacking a broader view.</p>
        <h4>HCI and Data Science</h4>
        <p>Several studies in HCI, CSCW, FAT (Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency, and critical data studies have begun to look at facets of these diverse topics.</p>
        <p>Dealing with data, or data wrangling, has been estimated to take up 80-90% of the effort in a typical data science project [11, 16, 30]. Understanding how people approach their data is therefore important. Bilis contrasted two views of the analystâ€™s relationship with data [4]. In one view, the analyst takes a relatively passive stance, and receives data as "given" by the environment ("donnÃƒÄ¾"). In a second view, the analyst takes a more active role as s/he captures data ("capta"). Pine and Leboiron made a similar point, claiming that in some cases "human-computer interactions start before the data reaches the computer because various measurement interfaces are the invisible premise of data and databases" (emphasis in their original text) [28]. Feinberg describes the "design" of data [9], and Patel et al. similarly describe the creation of features for analysis [27]. Muller et al. documented the sometimes necessary processes of the creation of data, including the creation of grounded truth data [24].</p>
        <p>Passi and Jackson described an ongoing tension over the use of algorithms as rules [25]. They propose that data science students learn to practice a kind of data vision that emphasizes the discretionary craftspersonship needed to appropriately handle data analysis. This notion of "crafts[person]ship" appears again in studies of how novices develop machine learning models: novices fail when they cannot intuitively relate how the code they write interplays with the data itself [27, 35]. This problem becomes especially important from an HCI perspective, in which domain knowledge is often crucial to understand how to analyze a topic and its data (e.g., [34]). Recording the outcomes and managing the diverse experimental analytic histories (i.e., provenance) of data and code are also challenging. Despite the promise of literate programming [20], people who engage in data science tend to scant their documentation, apparently because of a tension between dynamic, engaged exploration and time-consuming explanation [17, 18, 31].</p>
        <p>Despite the paucity of colleague-oriented documentation in many data science projects, there is increasing evidence that data science workers nonetheless collaborate. In an ethnographic study, Passi and Jackson reported on diverse actors, with diverse motivations, working in and with corporate data science teams [26]. They highlighted issues of trust among heterogeneous teams of designers, managers, business analysts, and data scientists, which are often resolved in part through work that is simultaneously "calculative" (e.g., reliance on quantified metrics, statistical tests) and "collaborative" (e.g., negotiation and translation work). Chang et al. proposed collaborative commenting in JupyterLab notebooks [6]. Recent tools such as <a href="https://cocalc.com/">Co-Calc</a> or <a href="https://colab.research.google.com">Colaboratory</a> provides real-time chat and multi-user storage in a notebook programming environment.</p>
        <h4>Tensions in Work with Data in Data Science</h4p>
        <p>In summary, the field of data science presents us with multiple tensions which might be addressed through HCI research. A partial list of these tensions would include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rules as constraints vs guidelines [25]</li>
          <li>Data as donnÃ¨ vs. capta [4]</li>
          <li>Data-driven vs. measurement-driven [21][28][32]</li>
          <li>Features as emergent vs. features as constructed [27]</li>
          <li>Exploration vs. explanation [18][31]</li>
          <li>Solitary vs. collaborative data science activities [6][26]</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some of these challenges may be resolvable. Other challenges may take the form of enduring analytic dimensions that inform our research plans and outcomes.</p>
