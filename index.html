        <p>We hope to gather the growing community of researchers and practitioners in HCI and allied fields who are building new insights, methods, and collaborative practices around data science. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):</p>
        <ul>
          <br>
          <li>Contextualize and understand data science work practices - by individuals, and by groups and teams</li>
          <li>Characterize the work practices of data science workers, including programming, ideation, and collaboration
          </li>
          <li>Building tools or methods to support human activities in data science work</li>
          <li>Show how practices of data creation and aggregation work of data science</li>
          <li>Understand the shared and unique design challenges of data science environments, including methods and tools for comprehending data, data wrangling, model building, debugging, collaborating and communicating results, especially to nonprogrammers</li>
          <li> Support the incorporation of diverse ethics and human values into data science work, e.g., in relation to algorithmic fairness or bias reduction.</li>
          <li> Bring sociotechnical and organizational perspectives on data work to bear on data science education and practice</li>
          <li>Suggest methods of standardizing or coordinating data collection across organizational and industry boundaries.
          </li>
          <li> Bridge the gap between the knowledge of data scientists and that of domain experts in various fields of application</li>
          <li> Widen the audience for data science beyond highly technically skilled programmers, to include UX designers, project managers, novice programmers, and other stakeholders into a data-driven project</li>
          <li> Help policymakers to build more effective, appropriate, and transparent rules around the complex domains of data science work</li>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Overview</h2>
        </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p class="lead" align="left">With the rise of big data, there has been an increasing need to understand who is working in data science, and how they are doing their work. HCI and CSCW researchers have begun to examine these questions. In this workshop, we invite researchers
            to share their observations, experiences, hypotheses, and insights, in the hopes of developing a taxonomy of work practices and open issues in the behavioral and social study of data science and data science workers. </p>
          <p class="lead" align="left">The outcomes of data science work are increasingly influential in much of the world. How people work in data science is equally important, if we are to understand, support, and critique as (appropriate) these important societal forces. We invite
            our colleagues to work with us for a deeper understanding of how human perform the work of data science.</p>
          <p class="lead" align="left">Extraordinary claims are made about the promises and current successes of data science. While some of these claims are stated for the future, Agarwal and Dhar editorialize that “This is powerful… we are in principle already there”. At a different
            extreme, scholars have criticized the “mythology” of such claims.</p>
          <p class="lead" align="left">Further complicating these discussions, there is considerable diversity in the tools and methods, challenges, and job-roles involved in data science. Detailed study will be necessarily partial and contextualized, adding depth of description
            and understanding, but potentially lacking a broader view.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p class="lead" align="left">Several studies in HCI and CSCW have begun to look at facets of these diverse topics. Passi and Jackson described an on-going tension over the use of algorithmic rules. They propose that data science students can learn to practice a kind of
            data vision that treats rules more as guidance (“rules-based”) than as formal constraint (“rules-bound”).</p>
          <p class="lead" align="left">Dealing with data, or “data wrangling,” has been estimated to take up 80-90% of the effort in a typical data science project. Understanding how people approach their data is therefore important.</p>
          <p class="lead" align="left">Bilis contrasted two views of the analyst’s relationship with data. In one view, the analyst takes a relatively passive stance, and receives data as “given” by the environment (“donné”). In a second view, the analyst takes a more active role
            as s/he captures data (“capta”). Pine and Leboiron made a similar point, claiming that in some cases “human-computer interactions start before the data reaches the computer because various measurement interfaces are the invisible premise of
            data and databases” (emphasis in their original text).</p>
          <p class="lead" align="left">Mentis et al. described curatorial practices with data among transplant surgeons as they engaged in the necessary work of “crafting the image” for one another, and Taylor et al. offered similar observations how a local community “enacted a multiplicity
            of ‘small worlds” in their data. Feinberg describes the “design” of data, and Patel et al. similarly describe the creation of features for analysis. Muller et al. documented the sometimes necessary processes of the creation of data, including
            the creation of grounded truth data.</p>
          <p class="lead" align="left">Recording the outcomes and managing the diverse experimental analytic histories of data science work are also challenging. Despite the promise of literate programming [KNUTH84], people engaged in data science tend to scant their documentation,
            apparently because of a tension between dynamic exploration and time-consuming explanation.</p>
